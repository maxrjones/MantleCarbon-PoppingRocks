## Key Points

* Bubble accumulation influences CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in Mid-Atlantic Ridge popping rocks.

* Mantle carbon concentrations are lower than previously suggested based on popping rock 2πD43.

* Pre-accumulation CO<sub>2</sub>/Ba ratios (16–22) provide evidence for heterogeneity in the depleted mantle ratio.

## Abstract

Despite the influence of mantle carbon on melt formation and migration, global volatile budgets, and
volcanic eruption styles, the carbon concentration in Earth’s upper mantle remains highly debated,
with estimates varying by more than an order of magnitude. The relationship between carbon and
incompatible trace element (e.g., Nb, Ba) concentrations in rare, undegassed mid-ocean ridge basalts
and melt inclusions provide primary constraints on upper mantle carbon content. Here we investigate
whether the most volatile rich mid-ocean ridge basalts, termed ‘popping rocks’, represent undegassed
magmas from the upper mantle and provide insight into upper mantle carbon inventory. We show
that fourteen new popping rocks, collected in situ from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge rift valley near 14°N,
contain highly variable CO<sub>2</sub>/Nb and CO<sub>2</sub>/Ba ratios despite similar mantle sources and extents of
melting. We revise the original model for popping rock formation using seafloor observations, high resolution
bathymetry, vesicle size distributions, major and trace element geochemistry, and noble gas
geochemistry. Highly variable volatile concentrations despite relatively homogeneous trace element ratios
and low <sup>4</sup>He/<sup>40</sup>Ar<sup>*</sup> suggest that bubble accumulation affected these popping rocks. These results provide
evidence for heterogeneity in the CO<sub>2</sub>/Ba ratio of the depleted mantle and indicate that mantle carbon
concentrations are lower and less heterogeneous than previously estimated, which influences models for
mantle melting and CO<sub>2</sub> flux at mid-ocean ridges.
